# RayTracerChallenge-C
An implementation of a basic Ray Tracer from the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge" using the C language.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)

The book explains what is Ray Tracing, the different aspects of how it is done, and test cases that must be passed for it to successfully work.
There is psuedocode that is presented so that the reader can use any language and I've decided to use C language for the following reasons:
  * To learn a little bit about 3D graphics, even if it's not math heavy.
  * An opportunity to learn C.
  * It would be more performant in C.
  * Writing this code on a Raspberry Pi to learn linux.
  * Can compare performance between different machines.
